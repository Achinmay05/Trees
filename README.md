# C++ Trees Implementation

## Description
This project demonstrates various types of tree data structures and their operations implemented in C++. It includes common tree structures such as Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and more. The project showcases key operations like insertion, deletion, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), and balancing of trees.

## Features
- **Binary Tree**: Implementation of a basic binary tree with traversal algorithms.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A tree where each node has at most two children, and the left child has a smaller value than the node, and the right child has a larger value.
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one.
- **Tree Traversal**: Includes preorder, inorder, postorder, and level-order traversal techniques.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Add and remove nodes while maintaining tree properties.
- **Balancing (for AVL Tree)**: Automatic balancing of the tree after insertion and deletion operations.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language used for the implementation.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Utilized for some data structures like vectors.
- **DevC++/VS Code**: Recommended IDEs for running the project.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
